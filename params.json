作为一个初学者，初次进来，既兴奋，又不知从哪儿搞起！为了缓解蛋疼，我将该页的英文翻译一下吧~

欢迎来到GitHub主页
Welcome to GitHub Pages.
\r\n
这种自动生成页面的生成器是唯您所有的工程创建漂亮页面的最简单的方式,
This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:
\r\n\r\n```\r\n
$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
\r\n
$ git fetch origin
\r\n
$ git checkout gh-pages
\r\n```\r\n\r\n
If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.
\r\n\r\n### 
Designer Templates
\r\n
We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.
\r\n\r\n### 
Rather Drive Stick?
\r\n
If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.

Authors and Contributors
\r\n
You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.
